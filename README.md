A fun little game of Hangman where the user gets eight wrong letters to guess a random word. Each try either reveals a letter or reveals the hangman, one piece at a time. 

This game was coded in OnlineGBD: [https://www.onlinegdb.com/ze4QIDHlD], and will likely work best when run on the website. You have to make an account (Google Account works), then press run on the top left corner; nothing needs to
be typed into "Command line arguments:" and the "Standard Input" choice should be defaulted to the "Interactive Console".
